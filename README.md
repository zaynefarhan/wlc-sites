# 🌐 Student Projects Hub

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is where all student projects and websites are hosted.  
Each folder belongs to a different student or project, and will be used to share work publicly or for class viewing.

- Each student (or team) gets their **own folder** in this repo.

- Once your work is pushed here, it can be **hosted online** through GitHub Pages!
